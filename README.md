# HACKATHON BARRIO ABAJO (TOTAL PROJECT COMPLETION: 80%)

This  React Web application is being developed to solve one of the issues our group members were able to notice during the Bootcamp in Barrio Abajo that 
took place on Friday November 1 2019. We proposed the creation of events that would take place in Barrio Abajo. The creation of events was
left to the public.

## Meet the current requirements (WEB):
